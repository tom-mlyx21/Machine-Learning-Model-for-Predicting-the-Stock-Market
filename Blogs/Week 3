Project Pivot and direction change
== Weekly Meeting ==
During the weekly meeting it was discussed that the approach of programming both a sentiment extraction learner, and
classifier was both above the 20 credits.
The better agreed upon approach was to change the direction of the project, utilise the available python libraries
and build a fully functioning program, heavily justifying the choices for each library used

== Program Progress ==
Following the meeting, through the use of the nltk library, and the "Vader Lexicon" module, a sentiment extractor
was constructed. This provided a solid basis for converting the vast amount of news headlines to machine digestible
features. Features include Source, word count, sentence length, positive, negative, neutral, and compound.
These features have been selected on their intuitive relevance to the stock market.
The final product was an effective text to data converter that is capable of converting the entire pandas dataframe
