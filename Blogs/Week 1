Project Outline and Partial Lit review:
Most of the week taken up by putting together a project outline.

== Feedback ==
The finished project outline was too brief, failing to define specific objectives and tools.
The features were undefined, with no indication to which metrics were to be used.
Work on detailing the specifics
