# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Predicting-the-Stock-Market
A Bayesian Sentiment Extractor for analysing news headlines and predicting the movement of the Stock Market
The first Bayesian Model will extract sentiments from the news headlines and the second model will predict the movement of the stock market based on the sentiments extracted from the news headlines.
The First metrics will consist of items such as positive Sentiment, negative sentiment, length of headline, digrams, trigrams, strength indicator.
The Second bayesian model will take the collected data from the first model and predict the movement of the stock market.

The validity of the model is then to be tested again the xgboost model and the results will be compared.
